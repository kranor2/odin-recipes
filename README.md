In this project, I will be practicing the basic HTML knowledge I have
built, including the boilerplate, using tags for text, links, and
images, and nesting elements. For this practice, I will be applying
this knowledge in the process of building a basic "brutalist" recipe
website, consisting of a main index page which will have links to a few
of my favorite recipes.

By the end of this project, I hope that I will feel more confident in
basic HTML skills like the boilerplate becoming muscle memory.
